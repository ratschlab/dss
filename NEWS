------------------
0.1.3 (2009-06-06)
------------------

You can now specify pre-rm/post-rm-hooks that are executed whenever
a snapshot is deleted. This release adds better compatibility with
rsync 3.0, and avoids busy loops when automatically restarting the
rsync process.

------------------
0.1.2 (2009-03-05)
------------------

This release includes the reason why a snapshot gets removed in the
log message. It will never remove the snapshot that is currently
being created. It will really pass the full path to the last complete
snapshot in the post_create_hook.

------------------
0.1.1 (2008-11-13)
------------------

This release prevents busy loops on rsync exit code 13. It ignores
any snapshot directory with creation time &gt; completion time. It
opens /dev/null for reading and writing when executing rsync. It shows
human readable snapshot creation duration when listing snapshots. It
restarts the rsync process if it returned with exit code 13.

------------------
0.1.0 (2008-10-10)
------------------

Initial public release.
