Type

	make

in the dss source directory to build the dss executable. You
likely need a recent version of gnu gengetopt,
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gengetopt/, to compile dss.

dss is known to compile on Linux, MacOS, Solaris, FreeBSD and
NetBSD. However, it is run-tested on Linux only.

Also make sure that rsync, http://rsync.samba.org/, is installed on
your system. Version 2.6.1 or newer is required.

In order to create snapshots of the existing directory

	/tmp/foo

in the directory

	/tmp/bar,

execute the commands

	mkdir /tmp/bar
	./dss --run --source-dir /tmp/foo --dest-dir /tmp/bar

To print a list of all snapshots created so far, use

	./dss --list --source-dir /tmp/foo --dest-dir /tmp/bar

You might want to create the config file

	~/.dssrc

that contains the values for the source and the destination
directories. In the above example, this file would contain the
following lines:

	source-dir "/tmp/foo"
	dest-dir "/tmp/bar"

Using a configuration file allows you to simply type

	./dss --run

to start snapshot creation and

	./dss --list

to list all avalable snapshots.

Try

	./dss -h

for an overview of all supported command line options or

	./dss --detailed-help

for the full help text.
