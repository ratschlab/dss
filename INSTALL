Type

	make

in the dss source directory to build the dss executable and copy it to
some directory that is included in your PATH, e.g. to $HOME/bin or to
/usr/local/bin.

Note that you'll likely need a recent version of
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gengetopt/ (gnu gengetopt) to compile dss.

Optionally, type

	 make man

to create the man page of dss. This invokes help2man so make sure
that help2man is installed on your system. Note that the man page is
just the nroff variant of the output of "dss --detailed-help".

dss is known to compile on Linux, MacOS, Solaris, FreeBSD and
NetBSD. However, it is run-tested only on Linux.

Also make sure that http://rsync.samba.org/ (rsync) is installed on
your system. Version 2.6.1 or newer is required.

Example:
--------

Suppose you'd like to create snapshots of the existing directory

	/foo/bar

in the directory

	/baz/qux.

Create the config file

	~/.dssrc

that contains the values for the source and the destination directories
as follows:

	echo 'source-dir "/foo/bar"' > ~/.dssrc
	echo 'dest-dir "/baz/qux"' >> ~/.dssrc

Then execute the commands

	mkdir /baz/qux
	dss --run

In order to print the list of all snapshots created so far, use

	dss --list

Yes, it's really that easy. Of course, dss supports many more
features and config options such as taking snapshots from remote
hosts and several hooks that are executed on certain events, for
example whenever a snapshot was created successfully.  Try

	dss -h

for an overview of all supported command line options or

	dss --detailed-help

for the full help text.
