Type

	make

in the dss source directory to build the dss executable. You
likely need a recent version of gnu gengetopt,
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gengetopt/, to compile dss.

dss is known to compile on Linux, MacOS, Solaris, FreeBSD and
NetBSD. However, it is run-tested on Linux only.

Also make sure that rsync, http://rsync.samba.org/, is installed on
your system. Version 2.6.1 or newer is required.

Example:
--------

Suppose you'd like to create snapshots of the existing directory

	/foo/bar

in the directory

	/baz/qux.

Create the config file

	~/.dssrc

that contains the values for the source and the destination directories
as follows:

	echo 'source-dir "/foo/bar"' > ~/.dssrc
	echo 'dest-dir "/baz/qux"' >> ~/.dssrc

Then execute the commands

	mkdir /baz/qux
	./dss --run

In order to print the list of all snapshots created so far, use

	./dss --list

Yes, it's really that easy. Of course, dss supports many more
features and config options such as taking snapshots from remote
hosts and several hooks that are executed on certain events, for
example whenever a snapshot was created successfully.  Try

	./dss -h

for an overview of all supported command line options or

	./dss --detailed-help

for the full help text.
