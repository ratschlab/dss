Type

	make

in the dss source directory to build the dss executable and copy it to
some directory that is included in your PATH, e.g. to $HOME/bin or to
/usr/local/bin.

Note that you'll likely need a recent version of
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gengetopt/ (gnu gengetopt) to compile dss.

Optionally, type

	 make man

to create the man page of dss. This invokes help2man so make sure
that help2man is installed on your system. Note that the man page is
just the nroff variant of the output of "dss --detailed-help".

dss is known to compile on Linux, MacOS, Solaris, FreeBSD and
NetBSD. However, it is run-tested only on Linux.

Also make sure that http://rsync.samba.org/ (rsync) is installed on
your system. Version 2.6.1 or newer is required.

Examples:
---------

Suppose you'd like to create snapshots of the existing directory

	/foo/bar

in the directory

	/baz/qux.

Create the config file

	~/.dssrc

that contains the values for the source and the destination directories
as follows:

	echo 'source-dir "/foo/bar"' > ~/.dssrc
	echo 'dest-dir "/baz/qux"' >> ~/.dssrc

Then execute the commands

	mkdir /baz/qux
	dss --run

In order to print the list of all snapshots created so far, use

	dss --ls

Yes, it's really that easy.

The second example involves a slightly more sophisticated config file.
It instructs dss to exclude everything which matches at least one
pattern of the given exclude file, prevents rsync from crossing file
system boundaries and increases the number of snapshots.

	source-dir "/foo/bar"
	dest-dir "/baz/qux"
	# exclude files matching patterns in /etc/dss.exclude
	rsync-option "--exclude-from=/etc/dss.exclude"
	# don't cross filesystem boundaries
	rsync-option "--one-file-system"
	# maintain 2^6 - 1 = 63 snaphots
	num-intervals "6"

The /etc/dss.exclude file could look like this (see rsync(1) for
more examples)

 
	 - /proc
	 - /**/tmp/

Note that dss supports many more features and config options such
as taking snapshots from remote hosts and several hooks that are
executed on certain events, for example whenever a snapshot was
created successfully. Try

	dss -h

for an overview of all supported command line options or

	dss --detailed-help

for the full help text.
