dss creates hardlink-based snapshots of a given directory on a remote
or local host using rsync's link-dest feature.

dss is admin friendly: It is easy to configure and needs little
attention once the dss daemon is running because dss keeps track of
the available disk space and removes snapshots if disk space becomes
sparse or snapshots become older than the specified time.

It's also user-friendly because users can browse the snapshot
directories and see the contents of the file system at the time the
snapshot was taken. For example, users can simply copy data from the
snapshot directory back to the live system in case they deleted files
by accident.

Snapshot pruning takes place in a dyadic fashion: Many recent snapshots
are available, but the number of snapshots per time interval decreases
exponentially. For example, one can configure dss so that it keeps
16 snapshots not older than one week, 8 snapshots between one and
two weeks old, 4 snapshots between two and three weeks old and so on.
